## Gaussian Naive Bayes Email Classifier

## Description
This file contains a Python implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for the purpose of classifying emails into spam and non-spam categories. The classifier uses a dataset of emails, processes the textual content, and trains a machine learning model to predict the classification of new email instances.

## Libraries

## The following libraries are required to run this code:
- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- scikit-learn (for the Naive Bayes algorithm and accuracy assessment)

## Versions
The code was last tested using:
- Python
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of text files representing emails, organized into directories for spam and not spam. It is assumed that the dataset is pre-split into training and test sets.


## Installation and Execution
The file paths for the training and test email directories are already configured in the script. They are set using the notation ./'**'. This means that the script is ready to access the training and test data from the specified directories relative to the script's location. Ensure that your training and test data are placed in the correct directories as per this configuration.
